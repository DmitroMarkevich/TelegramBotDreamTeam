TelegramBotDreamTeam is a cutting-edge currency bot project implemented using Java 11 programming language and leveraging powerful libraries such as Spring Boot (including Spring JPA and Hibernate), jsoup, Gson, Telegram API, and Lombok. This bot provides real-time currency conversion and exchange rate information within the Telegram messaging platform.

# Technologies Used

#Telegram API
The Telegram API library empowers the bot to interact with the Telegram messaging platform. It facilitates sending and receiving messages, processing user input, and providing real-time currency information to users.

# Jsoup
Jsoup is a crucial library used for parsing HTML documents. In this project, it enables the bot to scrape currency-related data from web pages, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for currency conversion.

# Gson
Gson plays a vital role in working with JSON data. It facilitates the conversion of complex Java objects into JSON and vice versa. The TelegramBotDreamTeam project utilizes Gson to handle the exchange of data with external sources and the Telegram API.

# Lombok
Lombok is a library that significantly reduces boilerplate code in Java applications. It enhances code readability and maintainability by automating the generation of getters, setters, constructors, and other repetitive code snippets.
